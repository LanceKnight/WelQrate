Therefore, it is optimal to have counter-screens on different targets to test specificity.\n","\n","(4) For some projects, compounds were tested in multiple rounds. Therefore, assays often have hierarchical relations. From a single primary screen (Pr), active compounds (Pr_A) could be tested in multiple rounds of confirmatory screens (Cf_1, Cf_2, ..., Cf_final) or counter screens (Ct_1, Ct_2, etc.). Actives from confirmatory screens (Cf_actives) have a higher possibility of being true active. If an active compound is tested active in counter screens (Cf_actives), it is likely to be a promiscuous compound and should not be included.\n","\n","(4) It is important to know the relationship between assays. Active sets from downstream screens always have a lower false-positive rate than active sets from upstream screens due to better assay technologies on a smaller set of compounds. Therefore, final hits should be taken from the intersection of the very last confirmatory assays, without tested active in any counter-screen:\n","Final hits = [Cf_final1_actives ∩ Cf_final2_actives ∩ ...] \\ [Ct_1_actives ∪ Ct_2_actives ∪ ...]\n","\n","However, if the confirmatory assays are unrelated (tested on different set of compounds), then we might have to take the union of their active sets instead of the intersections as in this formula.\n","\n","(5) The hierarchical relations should be inspected carefully to see if follow-up confirmatory screens include extra compounds (Ex) that were not tested in earlier screens or tested inactive in earlier screens. If exist, these compounds require manual inspection.\n","\n","(6) Final inactives should be taken from primary inactives (Pr_inactives) (not inconclusive, unspecified, or probes), plus extra compounds that were tested inactive in conformatory screens (Ex_inactives), if justified.\n","Final inactives = Pr_inactives ∪ Ex_inactives"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ATTwCBtbNUua"},"source":["## 5.1.

Therefore, it is optimal to have counter-screens on different targets to test specificity.\n","\n","(4) For some projects, compounds were tested in multiple rounds. Therefore, assays often have hierarchical relations. From a single primary screen (Pr), active compounds (Pr_A) could be tested in multiple rounds of confirmatory screens (Cf_1, Cf_2, ..., Cf_final) or counter screens (Ct_1, Ct_2, etc.). Actives from confirmatory screens (Cf_actives) have a higher possibility of being true active. If an active compound is tested active in counter screens (Cf_actives), it is likely to be a promiscuous compound and should not be included.\n","\n","(4) It is important to know the relationship between assays.

This is because during molecular processing, changes in data representation and format could lead to inconsistency or redundancy in the datasets. Below are the two adjustments performed on our datasets. \n","\n","(1) Some of the InChIs in our datasets should be updated. This is because some of the InChI will be missing, since the PubChem Identifier Exchange service might not able to find the corresponding InChI for the aromatized, neutralized SMILES.\n","\n","(2) Presence of some additional duplicates resulted from molecular processing: While handling mixtures, there might be some mixtures whose component molecules are identical. For example, mixtures of organic and inorganic molecules (molX-ionA and molX-ionB) after removed the ions (ionA and ionB) will result in duplicates (molX). Moreover, since the original mixtures are different, their activities could be different. Therefore, we also need to check their activities while handling these duplicates.\n","- If all duplicates share the same results (active/inactive), we keep one of them, since it is likely that the organic molecule kept contributed more significantly to the activity of the mixture. \n","- If duplicates of the same molecules returned different activity, it is safer to remove both of them."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"GWSgFUD9pnVi"},"outputs":[],"source":["#import: \n","pre14_actives =
